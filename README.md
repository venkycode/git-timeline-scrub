# git-timeline-scrub

```
Sweet little script to move through git history. 
Useful for presentations or just to see how things have evolved.
```

Use `next` to go to next commit in main and stage changes in next to next commit
```
./git-timeline-scrub next
```

Use `previous` to go the parent commit of current commit 

```
./git-timeline-scrub previous
```
